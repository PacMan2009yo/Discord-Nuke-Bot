# Discord-Nuke-Bot
#Setting Up
You need Python 3.6 for this to work, after installing just open main.py in any IDLE. You may customize anything you want inside.
Make a Discord bot in the discord developer portal and invite it to a server you want to nuke. You must have administrator permissions on the server. To invite the bot, get the client id and copy it. If you don't know how to get your bot's client id, you can search on Google. Now invite the bot using this link, where it says "CLIENTIDHERE", paste your client id.
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTIDHERE&permissions=8&scope=bot
Inside main.py, scroll all the way down until you see token. Inside the "" put your bots token which again you can find in the Discord Developer Portal. Now just run the code, your bot should come online and now you can enter the commands.
#Using
The basic bot prefix is !
To use the bot you have to enter these commands.
!spam - Spams the chat
!channels - Creates hundreds of channels.
!roles - Creates hundreds of roles.

Thats it.
